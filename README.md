# Fuel-Consumption-and-Efficiency-ML
Machine Learning Project on Fuel Consumption Prediction of 70s and 80s vehicles.

Predicting Fuel Efficiency of Vehicles
In this series, we'd be going from data collection to deploying the Machine Learning model:

Data Collection - we are using the classic Auto MPG dataset from UCI ML Repository.
Define Problem Statement - We'll frame the problem based on the dataset description and initial exploration.
EDA - Carry our exploratory analysis to figure out the important features and creating new combination of features.
Data Preparation - Using step 4, create a pipeline of tasks to transform the data to be loaded into our ML models.
Selecting and Training ML models - Training a few models to evaluate their predictions using cross-validation.
Hyperparameter Tuning - Fine tune the hyperparameters for the models that showed promising results.
Deploy the Model using a web service - Using Flask web framework to deploy our trained model on Heroku
